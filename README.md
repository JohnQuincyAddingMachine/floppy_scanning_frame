# Floppy Scanning Frame

My scanner cuts off a little bit of the inside edges if you push something into the corner, so when I scan floppies after archiving them, the end result looks crummy.

This is a 3D-printable frame to assist with consistent scans. It has an indentation for a 3½" floppy on one side, and a 5¼" floppy and sleeve on the other. Very fancy.

Designed (if you can call it that) in FreeCAD.
